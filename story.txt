Once upon a time, there was a donkey who was in love with a giant dragon. 
Donkey and dragon marriages were forbidden in his land, but the donkey was willing to be executed for his bae.

They got married and lived happily ever after, but then, everything changed when the fire nation attacked.

Donkey and giant dragon were forced apart... each unwillingly put against eachother in the ongoing war.
Donkey being captured for the earth kingdom, and giant dragon on the string of the evil fire nation. 
Not only were Donkey and giant dragon on opposite sides.. they were made to fight eachother.. or else. 
With the staged fight coming up soon, Donkey tried his damned hardest to find a way to reach giant dragon, 
in order to make a truce, or find a way for both of them to survive, and truly live.. happily after ever. 
Yet, while Donkey was traversing through the catacombs under the fire nation.. he ran into the legendary.. 
Cabbage Merchant. A fight obviously insued in whether Donkey could get past this merchant without knocking
all of his cabbage off of his wagon. To everyone's suprise, as Donkey was tip toeing past the wagon, we slipped on 
3 bananas lathered on the floor and the cabagges flew everywhere as the merchant's mood inflamed once again...
